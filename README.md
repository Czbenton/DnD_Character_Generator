## Synopsis

Hi there! This is just a simple side project that I am working on during some free time. The goal is to have a random character generator for **DnD 5th edition** that has a clean and friendly user experience. This is also a project for me to work on my vanilla JavaScript skills. No fancy frameworks or backend happening here.

## Motivation

I love DnD and wanted to give back to the community. I want to make an enjoyable character creation experience for anyone interested.
